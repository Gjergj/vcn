## vcn notarize

Notarize an asset onto the blockchain

### Synopsis


Notarize an asset onto the blockchain.

Notarization calculates the SHA-256 hash from an asset 
(file, directory, container's image). 
The hash (not the asset) and the desired status of TRUSTED are then 
cryptographically signed by the signer's secret (private key). 
Next, these signed objects are sent to the blockchain where the signer’s
trust level and a timestamp are added. 
When complete, a new blockchain entry is created that binds the asset’s
signed hash, signed status, level, and timestamp together. 

Assets are referenced by passed arg(s) with notarization only accepting 
1 arg at a time.
